I thrive at the intersection of design, engineering, and business, and Iâ€™m constantly refining systems to deliver real outcomesâ€”whether itâ€™s automating inventory for small businesses or crafting payment flows from scratch. When Iâ€™m not building platforms, Iâ€™m mentoring, working on agricultural systems, or experimenting with new sounds at ID RCRDSs. Always open to collaborating, especially on bold ideas that bring structure to chaos.","resume":{"tagline":"ðŸ‘‹  I'm a software engineer, product designer.","description":"I have delivered world-class user experiences to thousands of people.
